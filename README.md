Boilerplate for building applications with a React frontend and a C++ gRPC backend.

## How To Run

### Backend
1. Install [Bazel](https://bazel.build/install)

Bazel is for building the backend service, using Bazel is much easier than using Makefile or CMake. Itâ€™s recommended to use the Bazelisk to manage the appropriate version of Bazel.

2. Launch backend service locally

Run the following command from the **backend** directory:
```
bazel run :greeter_server
```
Make sure the backend service is running successfully.

### Frontend

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

NVM manages the version for node.js. It's recommended to use the `--lts` version of the node.js.

2. Launch frontend app locally

Run the following commands from the **frontend** directory to install all dependent packages and launch the frontend app:
```
npm i
npm run start
```
Make sure the frontend dev app is running successfully.

### Proxy

React frontend can't communicate with the gRPC backend server directly. Browsers have to connect to gRPC services via a special proxy called [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy).

In order to enable the Envoy Proxy, a docker image is required to be running locally.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Build the docker image

Run the following command from the **frontend** directory.
```
docker build -t cpp-grpc-react .
```
This builds a Docker image with the name cpp-grpc-react. Now, we run the Docker:
```
docker run -d --name cpp-grpc-react -p 8080:8080 -p 9901:9901 cpp-grpc-react
```
Make sure the Docker image is running successfully.

## How To Develop

### Prerequisite

1. Install grpc-web code generator plugin

Following the [instruction](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web#code-generator-plugin) to download and install `protoc-gen-grpc-web` and `protoc`.

Make sure the `protoc` can compile the proto to the right Javascript code by running the following command from the **backend** directory:
```
protoc -I=. protos/helloworld.proto --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:../frontend/src --grpc-web_out=import_style=commonjs,mode=grpcwebtext:../frontend/src
```
Even the **protos** are in the **backend** directory, it's actually being used in both backend and frontend. The above command generates the corresponding Javascript file from the **protos** and save then to the **frontend/src/protos** directory.

2. Setup VS Code (Optional)

### Backend

Making changes in the backend is stright-foward. Editing the proto could update the service interface, and editing the cpp file could update the service business logic.

Once all changes are finished, using the `bazel run` command to launch the service locally.

To test the service manually, it's recommended to use the [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl). Follow the instruction to download the grpcurl, then interact with the local grpc server to verify it's working as expected.

E.g. running the following command will call the `helloworld.Greeter` endpoint and the server shall return the correct response:
```
grpcurl -d '{"name":"alex"}' -plaintext localhost:9090 helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
```

### Frontend

When the proto files get updated, it's required to re-generate the client Javascript files by running the `protoc` command above.
