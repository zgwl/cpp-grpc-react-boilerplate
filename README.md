Boilerplate for building applications with a React frontend and a C++ GRPC backend.

# Run App Locally

## Backend
1. Install [Bazel](https://bazel.build/install)

Bazel is for building the backend service, using Bazel is much easier than using Makefile or CMake. Itâ€™s recommended to use the Bazelisk to manage the appropriate version of Bazel.

2. Launch backend service locally

Go to the **backend** directory, and run the following command from the terminal:
```
bazel run :greeter_server
```
Make sure the backend service is running successfully.

## Frontend

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

NVM manages the version for node.js. It's recommended to use the `--lts` version of the node.js.

2. Launch frontend app locally

Go to the **frontend** directory, then run the following command from the terminal to install all dependent packages and launch the frontend app:
```
npm i
npm run start
```
Make sure the frontend dev app is running successfully.

## Proxy

React frontend can't communicate with the GRPC backend server directly. Browsers have to connect to gRPC services via a special proxy called [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy).
