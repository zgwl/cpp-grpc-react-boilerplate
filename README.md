Boilerplate for building applications with a React frontend and a C++ gRPC backend.

## How To Run

### Backend
1. Install [Bazel](https://bazel.build/install)

Bazel is for building the backend service, using Bazel is much easier than using Makefile or CMake. Itâ€™s recommended to use the Bazelisk to manage the appropriate version of Bazel.

2. Launch backend service locally

Run the following command from the **backend** directory:
```
bazel run :greeter_server
```
Make sure the backend service is running successfully.

### Frontend

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

NVM manages the version for node.js. It's recommended to use the `--lts` version of the node.js.

2. Launch frontend app locally

Run the following commands from the **frontend** directory to install all dependent packages and launch the frontend app:
```
npm i
npm run start
```
Make sure the frontend dev app is running successfully.

### Proxy

React frontend can't communicate with the gRPC backend server directly. Browsers have to connect to gRPC services via a special proxy called [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy).

In order to enable the Envoy Proxy, a docker image is required to be running locally.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Build the docker image

Run the following command from the **frontend** directory.
```
docker build -t cpp-grpc-react .
```
This builds a Docker image with the name cpp-grpc-react. Now, we run the Docker:
```
docker run -d --name cpp-grpc-react -p 8080:8080 -p 9901:9901 cpp-grpc-react
```
Make sure the Docker image is running successfully.

## How To Develop

### Prerequisite

1. Install grpc-web code generator plugin

Following the [instruction](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web#code-generator-plugin) to download and install `protoc-gen-grpc-web` and `protoc`.
